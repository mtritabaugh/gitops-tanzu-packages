Please note: This repository has been tested with TKGs (vSphere with Tanzu – 7U3). If you are using a TKGm cluster or your TKGs cluster has been attached to TMC, it will have the kapp-controller installed already and the package repository configured. In that case, modify or remove some of the [pre-reqs](https://github.com/beyondelastic/gitops-tanzu-packages/tree/main/pre-reqs) content on a fork of the repository. 

Please be aware, that this repository is not officially verified, tested or supported by VMware!
